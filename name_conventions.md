name conventions:

Session: Meeting of players to play poker together. Pausing, joining and leaving the session is possible.
Game: Time between the act of issuing cards to the players and showdown. Players fold automatically due to inactivity or loss of their internet connection. In this case the player remains in the session but will be marked grey for other players.
Round: “betting-round”
